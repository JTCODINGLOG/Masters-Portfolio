📂 1: Optimization, Math & IoT Systems
This assessment focuses on leveraging Python for both mathematical efficiency and distributed hardware communication.

Budget Visualiser (1.1_Budet_Visualiser.py): Implements advanced built-in functions like zip, filter, and lambda to process financial statements efficiently.

3D Vector Calculator (1.2_3D_Vector_Calculations.py): Performs linear algebra operations on 1D tensors using NumPy.

IoT Cellar Cooling System: A distributed network project using TCP/IP Sockets.

Server (task3_server.py): A multithreaded hub managing barrel registries and solenoid logic.

Sensor Client (task3_sensor_client.py): Simulates and transmits temperature telemetry.

Solenoid Client (task3_solenoid_client.py): Receives remote commands to control cooling valves.



📂 2: Concurrency & Parallelism Case Study
An analysis of execution models using "John's Morning Routine" as a benchmark for performance and overlapping tasks.

Sequential (task2.1): Synchronous execution where tasks are blocked until completion.

Asynchronous (task2.2): Uses asyncio to utilize waiting periods for concurrent task progression.

Multithreaded (task2.3): Employs ThreadPoolExecutor and thread-safe Lock mechanisms to manage a shared global state.



📂 3: Mini-Hackathon - Calorie Tracking System
A collaborative data-driven project focused on health metrics and algorithm optimization.

Post-Hackathon Improvements (File1_posthackhaton_improvements.py): Refined logic for calculating burned calories based on intensity, duration, and user metrics.

Data Integration: Utilizes Assessment3_exercise_dataset.csv to process and analyze large sets of exercise data.

Technical Report: Documentation of the optimization strategies and logic improvements implemented during the hackathon.

🛠 Technical Competencies
Networked Systems: Developing TCP/IP protocols for IoT hardware.

Parallel Computing: Managing race conditions and thread synchronization.

Data Analysis: Processing external datasets for health-tech applications.

Impartial Review
The Real: In Assessment 2, you accurately concluded that threading can be "counterproductive" for very quick tasks due to the overhead of lock management.

The Strength: Your Assessment 3 improvements show a strong grasp of refactoring raw hackathon code into a more maintainable, scalable structure.
